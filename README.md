# Unity Modern XR Sample

This tutorial covers how to setup a virtual reality project using Unity's new [XR system](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/XR.html). It specifically shows how to do so without using any of Unity's legacy tools **and** without any third party assets! This means it is incredibly lightweight, requiring only a single script to function. The full tutorial can be found at [our website](https://rgbschemes.com/blog/setting-up-unity-xr-in-2020/).
